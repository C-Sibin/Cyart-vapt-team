By trying to access ***http://localhost:8180/manager/*** it will ask for a username and password. Some companies forget to update the default credentials, especially in older versions. This  repo(https://github.com/0xGabe/Apache-Tomcat-Default-Credentials) contain some of them

After uploading the war file then we need to trigger the payload, To trigger this payload, we have to load the file by trying to access it

Then we got the tomcat user shell using the nc listner on **port:1234**
