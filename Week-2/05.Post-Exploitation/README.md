## Privilege Escalation
There are various way to escalate the privilege some of the common method is 
- SUDO
- SUID
- Crontab
- Weak permissions
and many more

By trying various different ways i found a privilege escalation vector in SUID which is a +s special permission file
It is said to be whoever excecuting the file will , the file will be execute as owner
SUID bit :
### find / -type f -perm -04000 2>/dev/null

upon reviewing the result the nmap command has the special file permission

Using GTFO bin to search for nmap privilege escalation
