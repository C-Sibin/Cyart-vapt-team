# Advanced Exploitation
## Lab Setup:
Attacker - kali linux (192.168.17.30)
Target    - Chronos VM (192.168.17.132)

## Overview:
Performed a pentest at the target and identified various security weaknesses in the system , the most critical bug is “Command execution” in the format parameter which leads to  Remote code execution which makes the attacker take control over the entire system.

Sno | Description               | Target IP      | Status  | Payload
----|---------------------------|----------------|---------|-----------
 01 | Command Injeaction to RCE | 192.168.17.132 | Success | Shell

## Description:
The Chronos web application exposes a date formatting feature at /date?format= that passes user‑supplied input directly into a server‑side command or formatter without proper validation or sanitization. By injecting a system command in the parameter with the base58 format able to run the commands in the system this allowed an attacker to take over the complete system.
Scanned the Target for open Ports

1. Found the Domain name of the target in the page source
2. Added the domain in the host file
3. Headed to the chronos.local:8000 page and noticed some parameter with encoded value , when viewed in network tab
4. Identified the encode string it is a base58 string , decode using CyberChef
    Decode value : ‘%A, %B %d,  %Y, %H:%M:%S’
5. The decode value looks like a command used with date command 
6. Creating the normal command to confirm the vulnerability
7. Capturing the Request and injecting the encode ls command which provide a successful execution
8. Created a reverse shell payload and encode it in base58 and injected the payload
9. Keep the listener in the attacker machine

## Remediation:
● Remove all direct shell command construction using user input for the
/date?format feature.
● Implement strict input validation and allowlist only safe date‑format tokens.
● Use safe APIs instead of shell calls (e.g., native date/time libraries in
Node.js/Python/Java).
● Apply least privilege to the web service account and monitor for suspicious
outbound connections.
